% Software maintenance starts as early as the first software artifacts are
% delivered, and is characterized by its high cost and slow speed of
% implementation~\citep{swebok2004}. It has been stated that it is the most
% expensive activity of software development, taking up to 90\% of the total
% costs~\citep{Eastwood1993,Erlikh2000}. However, despite of the high cost, it is
% mandatory to ensure the success of the software project. \citet{Lehman1980}
% argues, in his \emph{Continuing Change} law of software evolution, that the
% modification of software is a fact of life for software systems if they are
% intended to remain useful. \citet{Bennett2000} reinforced such an argument for
% the specific case of useful and successful software, where almost all of them
% have a common practice of stimulating user-generated \ac{cr}. Actually, software
% maintenance is driven by \acp{cr} reported by many stakeholders, such as
% developers, testers, team leaders, managers, and clients.

A eficiente e incessante evolução da tecnologia traz consigo a grande oportunidade — como também a necessidade — de tornar as tarefas cotidianas dos seres humanos cada vez mais triviais e informatizadas, ou seja, realizar uma tarefa de forma que exija o menor esforço possível, dessa forma, algo que requisitaria tempo e atenção de alguém vem a se tornar uma tarefa simples para um computador.

As aplicações móveis, habitualmente conhecidas por \acp{app}, são exemplos claros e amplamente difundidos atualmente, visto que cada vez mais tarefas, desde o envio de mensagens até o pagamento de contas, podem ser realizadas nas palmas das nossas mãos, basicamente utilizando um \textit{smartphone} com acesso à Internet. O que há pouco mais de uma década era visualizado como uma atividade exclusiva tecnologicamente de um \ac{pc}, fosse através de uma aplicação \textit{web} ou \textit{desktop}, hoje é facilmente feito por soluções adaptadas ou similares para as telas dos celulares, tornando-se uma atividade corriqueira na vida da maioria das pessoas.

% No curso de \ac{ba} na \ac{ufape}, o desenvolvimento de um \ac{tcc} é necessário para que os discentes obtenham o diploma. Um grande problema observado é a diĄculdade enfrentada por um grande número de alunos na escolha de um tema para o desenvolvimento de seu trabalho e no encontro de algum professor que esteja disposto a orientá-los.

% Nesse sentido, Custodio (2016) desenvolveu o protótipo de uma aplicação web com
% o objetivo de automatizar a relação entre orientadores e estudantes na fase de realização
% do trabalho de conclusão de curso. O sistema foi implementado utilizando as linguagens
% JSP, CSS e Javascript e permite que os docentes publiquem propostas de temas para que
% os discentes possam escolher o de maior interesse.
% Levando em consideração a temática abordada por Custodio (2016) em seu trabalho, este trabalho de conclusão de curso tem como objetivo desenvolver uma aplicação web
% com algumas características semelhantes ao trabalho anteriormente desenvolvido, porém
% utilizando outras tecnologias, melhorando alguns atributos já existentes e implementando
% novas funcionalidades. Dessa maneira, a aplicação desenvolvida pode vir a ser implantada
% para uso dos docentes e discentes da UFU.


\section[Motivação]{Motivação}

 — Apresentar e discorrer sobre a motivação do projeto em si. — 
% Despite \ac{cr} repositories claimed benefits to software maintenance and
% evolution, handling \acp{cr} is not cost-free. For example, when new \acp{cr}
% are reported they must be assigned to developers which have adequate expertise
% to address the request~\citep{Aljarah2011,Hosseini2012,Kagdi2012}. Finding the
% appropriate developer is crucial for obtaining the lowest, economically
% feasible, fixing time~\citep{Lucca2002}. Nevertheless, assigning \acp{cr} to
% developers is a labor-intensive and time consuming
% task~\citep{Anvik2006,Jeong2009}. Indeed, depending on the project being
% developed, the amount of \acp{cr} that are reported and need to be assigned can
% vary from dozens to hundreds per day~\citep{CavalcantiSQJ2011}.

% \figref{fig:assignment-schema} shows the activity of assigning \acp{cr}.
% At the top-left corner of the figure, there are the \acp{cr} which have been
% reported to the software project. At the bottom-left corner, there is a set of
% developers which could be assigned to those \acp{cr}. Then, at the center, the
% assignment of \acp{cr} is performed; the \acp{cr} and developers must be
% matched, and each developer should fix one or more \acp{cr}. Commonly, the
% matching is performed aiming at the shortest time and the highest quality for
% the \ac{cr} fixing activities.

% \begin{figure}[htp]
% \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/assignment-schema.pdf}
%   \caption[\ac{cr} assignment.]{\ac{cr} assignment. The router, which may be the
%   \acs{ccb}, project leaders, or managers, must match \acp{cr} and developers in
%   order to obtain the shortest fixing and highest quality.}
%   \label{fig:assignment-schema}
% \end{figure}

% \lipsum[2-4]

% Nevertheless, by increasing the amount of reported \acp{cr} or the size of the
% development team, it is visible that the router becomes overloaded and the
% \ac{cr} assignment becomes an intensive, error prone activity. It was confirmed
% by \citet{Jeong2009}, which identified that 37\%-44\% of the \acp{cr} in Mozilla
% and Eclipse projects did not reach the right developer in the first assignment.
% These \acp{cr}, in turn, had their fixing time delayed because they needed to be
% reassigned one or more times. Furthermore, if the \acp{cr} are not fixed by the
% appropriate developers, there is also the chance of introducing new defects
% during the \acp{cr} fixing.

% In this context, we believe that it is necessary to develop methods and tools to
% automate the assignment of \acp{cr} and ensure that the \acp{cr} are being
% assigned to the appropriate developers. With these methods and tools, we could
% reduce the time needed to perform the assignments and, given that the
% appropriate developers are actually being selected, the quality and time for the
% \ac{cr} fixing are also improved.

\section{Objetivo}
\label{sec:objetivo}

% As previously mentioned, software maintenance has been considered as the most
% costly aspect of software development~\citep{swebok2004}. There is a myriad of
% reasons for this situation. One of them is the many changes that are required
% after software delivery due to poor documented and misunderstood requirements,
% or simply because \emph{``the clients do not know what they
% want''}~\citep{Brooks1995}.

% Another reason is the fact that a set of development activities must be
% inevitably performed in order to implement a change. For instance, for each
% change to be implemented it is necessary to comprehend the existing software
% artifacts, modify the software's source code to implement the change, perform
% tests and verification, and deliver the new version of the software.
% Additionally, very often, the implementation of the change ends up by
% introducing new defects in the software.
   
% A third reason is the management aspects of software maintenance. It is
% necessary to keep track of all these changes that are performed, generally
% considering different versions of the software and customers.

% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item Firstly, the approaches available in the literature were designed to
%   perform autonomously. That is, the software analysts do not have the control
%   of the approach; they cannot modify the approach's behavior. Without
%   such control, in turn, the approach cannot be properly calibrated. As a
%   consequence, if the approach's performance is not satisfactory, it is simply
%   discarded.
%   \item Secondly, the reported values for accuracy of these approaches are
%   still low. With low accuracy, the previous reason takes place. That is, as the
%   approaches perform with low accuracy, and the software analysts do not have
%   control over them, the approaches are simply discarded.
%   \item Finally, the third reason concerns the lack of contextual information in
%   those approaches. As is well known, software development companies are
%   dynamic: developers move from projects; developers are hired/fired;
%   developers enter in vacation or take a day off; and developers have different
%   experiences. This dynamic influences the assignment of \acp{cr}. Thus,
%   contextual information is a necessity in automated approaches.
% \end{enumerate}

% Based on this context, the main research question investigated by this thesis is:

% \begin{description}
%   \item[Research question] \emph{Is it possible to develop a new approach for
%   automated \ac{cr} assignment with satisfactory accuracy, leveraging
%   contextual information, and designed in order to put the software analysts in
%   control of such approach?}
% \end{description}

% With the objective to answer this question, it is necessary to understand
% current approaches available in the literature, choose the correct technologies
% that could support dynamic environments and, mainly, understand the necessities
% of software analysts regarding a new approach for automated \ac{cr} assignment.
% Thus, the goal of the work described in this thesis can be stated as:

% \begin{description}
%   \item[Research objective] \emph{This work proposes an automated approach for
%   \ac{cr} assignment which uses \ac{ir} models, expert systems, and
%   context-aware information in order to select the appropriate developers. The
%   approach is supported by the state-of-the-art in the management of \acp{cr} as
%   well as by the understanding of the aspects concerning the \ac{cr} assignment
%   activity itself.}

\section{Visão geral da proposta}

 — Apresentar e discorrer sobre o objetivo do projeto em si. — 

% \section{Research Methodology}

% This research design of this thesis is based on a multimethod
% approach~\citep{Hesse-Biber2010}. Such approach combines two or more
% quantitative (or qualitative) methods in a single study, such as a survey and an
% experiment~\citep{Hesse-Biber2010}. Multimethod must not be confused with mixed
% method. In this last, methods for both qualitative and quantitative types of
% research are applied in a single study. On the other hand, multimethod studies
% combine different methods for a single research type.

% When applying a multimethod approach, the triangulation is used to consolidate
% the results from the different methods, considering, however, that the same
% research question(s) was/were investigated in these methods. As a consequence,
% the triangulation of methods enhances the conclusions and completeness of the
% study, bringing more credibility to the research
% findings~\citep{Hesse-Biber2010}. \figref{fig:research-methodology-thesis} shows
% the multimethod research design applied in this thesis.

% \begin{figure}[h]
% \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/research-methodology-thesis.pdf}
%   \caption[Research methodology.]{The research methodology applied for this
%   thesis.}
%   \label{fig:research-methodology-thesis}
% \end{figure}

% The design started by stating the research objective, which we defined in
% \secref{sec:intro-problem-statement}, and performing the initial literature
% review. This last provided the basic concepts and understanding of the area.
% Then, a systematic mapping study and a questionnaire-based survey were
% conducted. These two gathered detailed information on our research topic.
% Indeed, both of them were used to understand the key aspects of \ac{cr}
% assignment and identify the set of requirements to automate the assignments. In
% the evidence synthesis step, these results were detailed and organized in order
% to formulate the approach to automate \ac{cr} assignments, which was constructed
% in the next step. Finally, the research design states the validation of the
% proposed approach.

% \section{Out of Scope}

% As the proposed approach is part of a broader context, a set of related aspects
% will be left out of its scope. Thus, the following topics are not directly
% addressed in this thesis:

% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item \textbf{Tools for \ac{cr} management.} We are addressing
%   a specific aspect of \ac{cr} management, which is the \ac{cr} assignment
%   activity. Thus, it is out of scope of this thesis to provide a
%   complete solution for \ac{cr} management. Instead, we are planning to
%   implement standalone software which will be able to integrate with the
%   most well known tools for \ac{cr} management, such as Mantis, Bugzilla, and
%   Trac, providing a service to leverage the automation of \ac{cr}
%   assignments.
  
%   \item \textbf{Software maintenance process.} Software maintenance involves
%   a set of activities aiming at implementing modifications in some software
%   project. These activities must be coordinated through a process so that the
%   maintenance can be successful. In Chapter 2, we discuss some of
%   these processes. However, in this thesis, we are not concerned with the
%   maintenance process itself. Actually, it should be transparent in our approach
%   to automate \ac{cr} assignment. Thus, it is out of scope of this
%   thesis to provide any process assessment for software maintenance beyond the
%   activity of \ac{cr} assignment.
  
%   \item \textbf{\ac{ir} models.} Many models for \ac{ir} have been proposed for
%   different objectives, including the \ac{cr} assignment itself. However, due to
%   the broad availability of these models, it is out of scope of this thesis to
%   develop a new one. Instead, the \ac{ir} models with better performance,
%   identified through the systematic mapping study, were chose to be
%   integrated in our approach;
  
%   \item \textbf{Rule-based expert systems.} Similar to \ac{ir} models,
%   rule-based expert systems have a long history of development. Thus, our
%   approach does not intend to develop a whole new system with this purpose.
%   Actually, we integrated in our approach the
%   Drools\footnote{\url{http://www.jboss.org/drools/}} expert system, which is a
%   mature tool that can be easily manipulated;
  
%   \item \textbf{Mathematical formulations on NP-Complete problems.} We
%   understand that the problem of assigning \acp{cr} to software developers is in
%   the broad category of \emph{assignment problems}, which is well known to be
%   NP-Complete. Thus, could be formulated as such. However, the mathematical
%   formulations of the \ac{cr} assignment problem is out of scope of this thesis.
%   As well as finding an optimal solution on the context of NP-Complete problems
%   is also out of scope. The main reason for this is the human factors and
%   context variables that are involved in the assignment of \acp{cr}, which
%   make this problem hard to be computable. A mathematical formulation of the
%   \ac{cr} assignment problem is provided by~\citet{Rahman2009}.
